I had heard a lot about tree-sitter, but never quite bothered to look into it.
It is a tool to make robust language parsers with a relatively simple syntax.

Some people use this for handling indentation or handling text coloring of their
code.   What is interesting is that the last two are done usually with "queries"
that are ran against the generated tree.
